# ugh
Prints out a word of your choice to the console in fun patterns. Right now the output is a very basic "down and to the right" pattern, but more fun designs will be added as the project grows. :)

### Running
ugh takes exactly three arguments to run.

```
$ python [word] [times] [sleep]
```

word  - the word to be printed  
times - the number of times you want to print the word (both down and across)  
sleep - how long to sleep for in between the printed lines  

example:
```shell
$ python ugh-1.1.py ugh 34 .05
```
